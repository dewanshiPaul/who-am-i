## Problem Statement 
The problem at hand is that there is currently no single platform available that allows coders to not only visualize their coding platform but also create a resume. Coders who want to showcase their coding skills and experience often have to use multiple tools or platforms to accomplish this, which can be time-consuming and inconvenient. This fragmented approach may also result in inconsistencies in the way their coding portfolio and resume are presented, which can negatively impact their job prospects. Therefore, there is a need for a one-stop solution that integrates both coding platform visualization and resume creation, providing a seamless and streamlined experience for coders to showcase their skills and increase their chances of getting hired
